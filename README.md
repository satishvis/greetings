# The go `greetings` package

* Name the package as the folder and not main
* Exported functions to have Initial Capital in names.
* When you download the packages are cached and so to download the latest version we need to use something like this 
` sh
  GONOPROXY=github.com/clavinjune go get -d github.com/clavinjune/testng@latest`
